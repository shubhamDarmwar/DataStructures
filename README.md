# DataStructures

Welcome to the DataStructures repository! This project contains various data structures implemented in Jupyter Notebook. It serves as a comprehensive collection of different data structures, demonstrating their usage and functionality.

## Features

- **Data Structures:** Explore implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Educational:** This repository is designed to help students and professionals understand how different data structures work.
- **Interactive:** Utilize Jupyter Notebooks to interactively learn and experiment with the data structures.

## Repository Details

- **Language:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Owner:** [shubhamDarmwar](https://github.com/shubhamDarmwar)
- **License:** No license specified
- **Visibility:** Public

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamDarmwar/DataStructures.git
```

Navigate through the notebooks to explore various data structure implementations and their applications.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests to enhance the collection or improve existing implementations.
